# Financial-Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLP
Proof of Concept for applying NLP techniques for sentiment analysis with financial data. This uses the yfinance package to gather real-time news articles for analysis, along with applying LIME, which is a non-negotiable in finance. This gives us a look into the 'black box' model that we are using and why it is predicting what it is predicting. This promotes trust in all parties involved, including but not limited to investors and compliance.

&#128204; **IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a PROOF OF CONCEPT ONLY, not production ready. Will keep working on this and as always, I am open to tips/suggestions!
